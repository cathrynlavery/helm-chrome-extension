We are finalizing the idle (not-in-focus) screen for premium polish and consistency.
This is our final pass for elegance and usability.

1. Remove the Extra Quote
Currently, two quotes are showing.

✅ Keep only one quote, placed below the "Today's Targets" section.

Apply .libre-baskerville-regular-italic styling.

Optional: set text opacity to ~70% for subtlety.

2. Update Color Palette to Brass Tone
Update all primary action and highlight colors to match:

✅ Hex: #CDAA7A (brass tone)

Apply to:

"Start Focus Session" button

Selected focus duration button (e.g., "45 min")

"+" icon in the "Today's Targets" section

Optional: any hover states / active states for consistency.

3. Improve Hover States & Readability
Hover states for all buttons:

✅ Darken the brass color slightly on hover for contrast.

✅ Ensure text remains fully readable (adjust contrast).

Optionally: add a soft shadow or subtle lift effect on hover for feedback.

For inactive time selections (e.g., "30 min"), make sure text color remains legible — avoid low contrast grays.

4. Button Text & Font Weight
Ensure button text uses IBM Plex Mono Medium for clarity and consistency.

Increase font weight if necessary for better visibility.

5. Input Field ("Today's Targets") Improvements
✅ Retain the "+" icon in the button.

✅ Increase horizontal padding inside the input for comfort.

Optional: On hover/focus of input field, add subtle border highlight in #CDAA7A for consistency.

6. Timer Circle Refinement
✅ Maintain the ambient glow / inner shadow in idle state.

✅ Optional: On selecting a focus time, animate a slight pulse in the circle to indicate readiness.

7. General Spacing & Layout
✅ Ensure spacing between "Today's Targets" and quote feels balanced.

✅ Maintain clean vertical alignment of all elements.

✅ No container backgrounds or shadows — keep the background seamless and unified.

Optional (Polish Layer)
Smooth background transition when switching from idle to focus mode.

Allow "Enter" key to trigger "Start Focus Session."

Add hover effect to time duration buttons (soft glow or highlight).

Outcome Expected
✅ Single, elegant quote beneath the targets section.

✅ Consistent brass tone across buttons, highlights, and iconography.

✅ Improved hover and active states for clarity and readability.

✅ No visual clutter, clean Apple-level finish.
