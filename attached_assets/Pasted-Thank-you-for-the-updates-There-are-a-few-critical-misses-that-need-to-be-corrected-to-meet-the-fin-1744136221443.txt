Thank you for the updates. There are a few critical misses that need to be corrected to meet the final design spec. Here’s exactly what needs to be fixed:”

1. Today's Targets Typography (⚠️ Missed)
🚫 Currently, this is still in the monospace IBM Plex Mono.

✅ Correct: Change the heading only ("Today's Targets:") to Libre Baskerville Regular font.

Typeface: Libre Baskerville

Weight: Regular

Style: Roman (not italic)

Only the heading — do not change the list items font (leave those in IBM Plex Mono).

2. Icon in Top Left (⚠️ Still Broken)
🚫 The icon in the top left corner is still visually broken.

✅ Fix: Remove any duplicate or layered icons.

✅ Ensure only one instance of the icon is rendered.

✅ Add clean spacing around the icon and text:

Suggested: 20–24px padding on top and left.

✅ Confirm alignment:

The Helm icon and the word "Helm" must be vertically aligned.

✅ Ensure text color adapts dynamically:

Light mode: dark color for the text.

Dark mode: brass color (#CDAA7A).

3. Work Profile Section (⚠️ Not Centered)
🚫 "Work Profile" (now "Focus Space") is still left-aligned.

✅ Fix: Center the text horizontally with the main circle below.

✅ Ensure clean alignment through the full vertical stack:

"Focus Space" → Streak → Timer Circle → Start Session Button → etc.

4. Today's Targets Spacing (🧩 Improvement)
✅ Pull "Today's Targets" section upward slightly.

Current spacing is too loose, causing visual disconnect.

✅ Aim for consistent vertical rhythm:

Maintain breathing room, but tighten gap between the timer section and "Today's Targets."

✅ Optional improvement:

Add a divider line or subtle visual separator between the timer module and the targets section.

Suggestion: use a soft, low-opacity line (#ccc or rgba equivalent) or a gradient line for elegance.

Ensure the line is subtle and does not overpower the design.
