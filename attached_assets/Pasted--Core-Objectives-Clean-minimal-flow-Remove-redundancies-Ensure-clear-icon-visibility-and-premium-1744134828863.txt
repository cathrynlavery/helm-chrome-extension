✅ Core Objectives
Clean, minimal flow. Remove redundancies. Ensure clear icon visibility and premium layout.

1. Remove Duplicate Streak Indicator
✅ Only display the streak once, above the timer circle.

✅ Remove the streak from the top header of the screen.

2. Simplify Focus Duration Selection
✅ Remove the "Select Focus Duration" label.

✅ Do not add any other inline label (remove the optional "Choose Duration" suggestion from earlier).

✅ Keep only the focus duration buttons (15 min / 30 min / 45 min).

3. Update Start Button Text
✅ Change button text from:

❌ "Start Focus Session"

✅ To: "Start Session"

✅ Keep styling and position as per below.

4. Improve Button & Layout Hierarchy
✅ Move the "Start Session" button closer to the timer and duration buttons.

✅ Place the "Today: X min focused" metric directly under the Start Session button for clear flow.

Maintain this structure:

Streak (single instance)

Timer Circle

Duration buttons

Start Session button

Today’s Focused Minutes metric

Today’s Targets

5. Today’s Targets Section
✅ Add clear spacing between the input field and target list.

✅ Maintain completed task style (strike-through, lighter text).

✅ Optional: keep or add subtle completion animation (if time allows).

✅ Optional: add small hover effect on "+" icon for interactivity.

6. Icon Update (Critical for Visibility)
✅ Use correct icon based on screen mode:

Idle screen (light background): use dark-icon.svg

Focus screen (dark background): use light-icon.svg

✅ Make icon switch dynamic based on state change.

✅ Ensure icon swap happens cleanly on session start and end.

Optional: smooth fade transition for icon swap.

7. General Spacing & Flow
✅ Increase spacing between profile/top line and main module.

✅ Maintain clean, readable section hierarchy.

✅ Ensure no visual clutter.

🎯 Goal Summary
✅ Clean, minimal UI with no redundancy.

✅ Dynamic icons for clarity and contrast.

✅ Button copy refined ("Start Session").

✅ Logical hierarchy of elements.

✅ Professional, Apple-level premium polish.
