Objective:
Add a new "Access Style" selection when creating a new Focus Profile, giving users two clear options:

‚úÖ Allow List: Block all sites except those the user selects.

üîí Block List: Allow all sites except those the user blocks.

Design Reference:
‚úÖ Please refer to the attached design screenshot for UI layout.
We already have the toggle design from the app version ‚Äî follow the same visual style.

"Choose Your Access Style" heading

Two selectable cards:

Left: Allow List (checkmark icon)

Right: Block List (lock icon)

Default selection = Block List

Behavior:
Selecting either option should visually highlight the active card (like shown).

Clicking one card deselects the other.

The selected mode should be stored in the profile data model.

Functional Requirements:
Data Model Update:

Extend the profile model to include:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "accessStyle": "allowlist" // or "blocklist"
}
Logic for Blocked Sites Selection:

If Block List is selected:

The user adds domains they want to block.

(Already works, no change needed.)

If Allow List is selected:

The user adds domains they want to allow.

All other domains will be blocked by default.

Important: Update copy in the site selection step to reflect:

"Add websites you want to allow during focus sessions."

Helper Text:

Below the selection cards, add helper text based on selection:

If Block List selected:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll block distracting sites while allowing access to everything else.‚Äù

If Allow List selected:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll block everything except the sites you‚Äôve selected.‚Äù

Default Experience:

When users land on the profile creation screen, default the access style to Block List for simplicity.

Validation:

For Allow List, warn if no sites are added:

"‚ö†Ô∏è You haven‚Äôt selected any allowed sites. All web access will be blocked during focus sessions."

Persistence:

Save user‚Äôs selection to the profile for later editing.

When editing an existing profile, the previous Access Style should be pre-selected.

Futureproofing:

Build the logic cleanly for future "Recommended Lists" (e.g., pre-built categories like "Social Media" or "Entertainment").
